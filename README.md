A summary of core features:

a powerful N-dimensional array
lots of routines for indexing, slicing, transposing, ...
amazing interface to C, via LuaJIT
linear algebra routines
neural network, and energy-based models
numeric optimization routines
Fast and efficient GPU support
Embeddable, with ports to iOS, Android and FPGA backends
